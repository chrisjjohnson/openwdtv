OpenWDTV is a feature rich custom firmware for the Western Digital TV Live.  It's primary focus is to provide a fully customized firmware that rivals other custom firmwares available but also to provide a development package for others to develop their own firmware.  I hope that other developers will fork this project onto their own github account and provide enhancements or even new packages to add to the project.

*IMPORTANT: Initial firmware version (v1.0) is due for release late October 2010 and will be made available via http://openwdtv.org.  Developer package will stable enough for public consumption late September 2010.  Code submittions are welcome at any time, but please don't try and build any firmware yet.

Developers
----------
Interactive build scripts automate the process of downloading new firmware releases from Western Digital, unpacking the firmware and applying dozens of feature updates and other modifications from a library of addon packages, then repacking the customized firmware into a signed binary that the user can then flash.

Addon packages include custom OSD's that change the look and feel of the on-screen interface, plugins that enable various new features and services that enable things like automated TV show downloading, an apache web server or even a http media streamer to stream to your music collection over the internet.
